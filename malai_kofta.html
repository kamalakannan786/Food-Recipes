                <p id="para1">This Malai Kofta is the ultimate North Indian showstopper! Crispy Indian cheese dumplings known as paneer kofta are served with a rich, luxurious & super delicious malai (creamy) gravy. This Malai Kofta curry is a celebratory dish that brings gourmet Indian flavors to your dinner table. It is an exciting side usually made for special occasions and meals.</p>
                <p id="para2">Whether you are hosting a North Indian themed dinner or want to whip up a special meal for your loved ones, this restaurant style dish fits the bill perfectly. In this post I share how to make the best Malai Kofta at home. The koftas are crisp on the outside, with a melt-in-the-mouth inside that you can also serve them as an appetizer.</p>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b0/aa/a4/b0aaa4cdf8103e50e74f675f25207332.jpg" id="imgmk">
                <p id="para3">The sauce is equally delicious - slightly spicy, tangy and creamy with a burst of flavors. 
                    Serve this classic vegetarian Indian dish with Butter Naan, whole wheat roti, paratha, Tandoori Roti, Plain steamed Basmati or flavored rice like Cumin Rice, Ghee rice or Turmeric rice. For a special or festive meal, extend your menu to some Halwa and raita. </p>

                    <h1 id="head">About Malai Kofta </h1>
                    <p id="para4">Malai Kofta is a curried vegetarian dish consisting of crisp fried potato paneer balls (koftas) dunked in a creamy, silky smooth and rich sauce/ curry. The Hindi word malai translates to cream and kofta to fried balls, so obviously the dish is made with cream (dairy)</p>
                    <p id="para5">Originally, Kofta belongs to a family of meatballs from the Central Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Balkan Cuisines. They come in different sizes & shapes like balls, patties and cylindrical. </p>

                    <p id="para6">In India, the vegetarian Malai kofta is hugely popular in the restaurants. There are also many other vegetarian variations using lauki (bottle gourd), mixed vegetables and raw bananas. North Indian restaurants typically serve this Malai Kofta in 2 colors - white and orange. </p>
                    <p id="para7">The white Mughlai gravy is made similar to this Methi Malai Matar or Shahi Paneer, without tomatoes, turmeric and red chili powder. But the orange one has a base similar like the Paneer Butter Masala. </p>
                 

                    <h1 id="recipe">Recipe</h1>
                    <p id="para8">These paneer kofta are made with a mix of mashed/grated boiled potatoes, crumbled paneer, corn starch (flour), spices and herbs. This mixture is shaped to small balls and deep fried. For a healthier option you may bake, air fry or use a paniyaram pan to pan fry them.</p>
                    <p id="para9">Every restaurant has a different formula to make their kofta gravy. But in general a paste made with boiled onions, cashews and sometimes poppy seeds are used to make the white gravy. My recipe is much simpler and makes use of tomatoes too as it makes a super perfect and delicious gravy.</p>
                    <p id="para10">Onions and cashews impart natural sweetness while tomatoes lend a tang and spices infuse the best aromas to the gravy. Many people feel making malai kofta at home is a very difficult task. But with proper planning and preparing ahead it is easy to make. It involves several preparation steps so it takes some time but is easy and not difficult.</p>
                    <p id="para11">For convenience, you may split the recipe and make the gravy the previous day or ahead. 
                        The day you plan to serve the malai kofta, just prepare the koftas and heat the gravy. 
                        Please read the Ingredients & substitutes and Pro Tips sections below.</p>

                <h1 id="is">Ingredients & Substitutes </h1>

                <ul id="mainlist">
                    <li class="list"><span>Boiled Potatoes</span> : Cook potatoes just until fork tender yet fully cooked. We don't want mushy and water-logged potatoes because that makes the koftas too soft and they can break & fall apart while frying. </li>
                    <li class="list"><span>Paneer</span> : You may use homemade or store bought paneer. Both work well equally. Your homemade paneer (if using) should be completely drained and not contain any whey. Too much moisture in the paneer can again make the paneer koftas too soft. You may substitute paneer with pressed extra firm tofu.</li>
                    <li class="list"><span>Corn flour</span>: Also known as corn-starch is used to bind the ingredients and give the koftas a crisp and firm texture. It can be substituted with arrow root powder, sattu (powdered roasted gram/chutney dal) or roasted gram flour/roasted besan. </li>
                    <li class="list"><span>Cashews </span> : add a creamy texture to the malai gravy. They can be substituted with almond flour or nut butter. But the flavors will be slightly different. If you can't eat nuts, simply use more heavy cream and cut down the amount of water. </li>
                    <li class="list"><span>Heavy Cream </span> : or whipping cream adds another layer of richness to the curry. You can omit it by using little more cashews or adding 2 to 3 paneer cubes while blending the onions and tomatoes. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="para">1. Heat a pan with 1 tablespoon oil. For a oil-free saute, you may start without oil & dry saute. Add </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 green cardamoms </li>

                    <li>1 cup cubed onions (2 medium). Saute until the onions turn transparent, for 3 to 4 mins. (Tip: If you do not have ginger garlic paste to add in step 6, you may add half inch peeled ginger slice and 3 medium garlic cloves here and omit using later. Avoid adding too much ginger, it can make the dish bitter.)</li>
